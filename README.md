# Framework for ALPIDE testing

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.cern.ch/alice-its-alpide-software/new-alpide-software/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.cern.ch/alice-its-alpide-software/new-alpide-software/commits/master)

## Build instructions

### Prerequisites
In order to build the software the following requirements must be installed 
(CC7 packages names):
- cmake3
- gcc
- gcc-c++
- make
- cmake3
- tar
- zlib
- wget
- subversion
- clang
- git
- libusb1-devel
- tinyxml-devel
- qt5-qtbase-devel
- krb5-workstation
- cern-get-sso-cookie

In addition you should have a working installation of
- ROOT (for ROOT-based analyses)
- Qt5 (for GUIs)
While the software can be built without these components, this results in
limited functionality and is discouraged.

### Initial build

First, clone the project:
```
git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/alice-its-alpide-software/new-alpide-software
```
Then, create and change to a build directory (it can but doesn't have
to be a sub-directory of the project source directory):
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
Prepare the build by running cmake (at least version 3.2, i.e. you
need to install the package cmake3 on CC7) in the build directory:
```
cmake <source directory>
```
and build the project with:
```
make -j $(nproc)
```
Now you can run the executables from the build directory.

### Updating the code
You can update the code with the latest version from the repository with:
```
git pull --rebase
```

On updates (from the repository or by your own changes) it suffices to
rerun `make` in the build directory:
```
cd build
make -j $(nproc)
```

## Using the software
It is recommended (at least for now) to run the software from the main build
directory. You do not need to set any environment variables (NB: no more
`source env.sh` for the GUI). The executables expect to find the configuration
files in the current working directory and will also write the output to Data/
in this directory.

TODO: add environment variables for config files and data output

## Advanced build options

### Configure the build
Even though not recommended, you can disable parts of the software. To do switch 
on the respective option using cmake, i.e.:
```
cmake -D<option>="ON"
```
The available options are:
- DISABLE_QT: Do not build Qt-based components (i.e. no GUI).
- DISABLE_ROOT: Do not build ROOT-based analyses.

### Installation

If you don't want to install to the system-wide default location
(/usr/local) you should (once) set a prefix directory for the
installation:
```
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>
```
Then, you can install the software by running `make install` in the
build directory:
```
make -j $(nproc) install
```

### Packaging

In order to build an rpm package, run `cpack` in the build directory:
```
cd build
cpack
```
